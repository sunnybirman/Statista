**Approach**
This is my approach to the problem

**Repository layer**
- Used Hashmap to store Booking Details in memory
- For quick lookup through Department, used another Hasmap to work as index.
- Repository implementation is loosely coupled, in future we can change behavior just by adding another implementation

**Service Layer**
- Service implementation is loosely coupled, in future we can change behavior just by adding another implementation
- Notification service is also loosely coupled with Service Implementation
- Mocked the email notification behavior, just by looging. In the production that should be handled by a decoupled Kafka application

  **Controller**
  - Used swagger to document API for easy adoption
  - Business logic is separate from API documentation
  

**Testing**
- Added Junit for Controller, Service, Repository implementation
- Code coverage is more than 70%

**Task**
**Prerequisites**

- JDK 8
- IntelliJ (recommended) or your favorite Java IDE
- Bash environment with installed 'curl' or Postman

**Preamble**
     
Your mission would you decide to accept it:

As part of the multi-disciplinary development elite team **PIT** in Statista you are creating software to alleviate the 
issues from our Sales team. For this, a new requirement has been raised to implement a RESTful web service that stores 
_booking_ objects in memory and return information about them.

Note: A _booking_ is a request from any of our beloved customers to acquire one of our products. 

**Challenge**

The module **code-challenge** already contains the basic structure of a Spring Boot application for you.

The bookings to be stored have the following fields:
 - booking_id
 - description
 - price
 - currency
 - subscription_start_date
 - email
 - department

Please define as many departments as you will like, and create a unique method `doBusiness()` for each department. This 
is your time to shine, so the method implementations can be as simple, elegant, or complicated as you want. 

Feel free to select the best data type that, in your opinion, would define those fields the best.

You should not use a database or some other sort of persistence but come up with an own data structure to store the 
transactions.

In any moment where the implementation implies the usage of an external server (i.e. sending e-mail's) feel free to mock
creatively these external resources, keeping in mind that all real-world use-cases must be covered.

In general, we are looking for a good implementation, code quality, code resilience, code extensibility, code 
maintainability and how the implementation is tested.
Basically something you wouldn't be too embarrassed to push to production.

**API Specification:**

**POST /bookingservice/bookings**

Sample Body:
```
{"description": "Cool description!", "price": 50.00, "currency": USD, "subscription_start_date": 683124845000, "email": "valid@email.ok", "department": "cool department"}
```

Creates a new booking and sends an e-mail with the details.

**PUT /bookingservice/bookings/{booking_id}**

Sample Body:
```
{"description": "Cool description!", "price": 50.00, "currency": USD, "subscription_start_date": 683124845000, "email": "valid@email.ok", "department": "another_department" }
```

Insert, replace if already exists a booking.

**GET /bookingservice/bookings/{booking_id}**

Returns the specified booking as JSON.

**GET /bookingservice/bookings/department/{department}**

Returns a JSON list of all bookings ids with the given department.

**GET /bookingservice/bookings/currencies**

Returns a JSON list with all used currencies in the existing bookings.

**GET /bookingservice/sum/{currency}**

Returns the sum of all bookings prices with the given currency.

**GET /bookingservice/bookings/dobusiness/{booking_id}**

Returns the result of `doBusiness()` for the given booking corresponding department.
